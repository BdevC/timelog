### About the Project ###
This is a demo application to demonstrate full-stack development capabilities. 
The application consists of the following microservices
- Front-end: a UI to allow the user to use the application
- authentication: Using Google and the recommended approach on Next.js
- logger: A passthrough to log user data separately from the front-end
Things to know...
- This is a work in progress
- I'm very used to Gitlab CI, but new to Github Actions

The following technologies are featured
- Kubernetes - A cluster to manage the services
- Scaffold - as an easy way to manage and develop with Kubernetes
- Kafka to manage asynchronous communication
- Docker to containerize the microservices
- Mongo to store the user data being logged
- Sign in with Google for Authentication


### Building Front-end ###

run npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
